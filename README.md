# Limitations of MC Dropout for Error Localization in 2-D Brain Tumor Segmentation 

1. Project title and description
Explain that this is an uncertainty analysis for 2D brain tumor segmentation using MC Dropout.

2. Dataset instructions
Explain where to download datasets and how to structure them locally (you donâ€™t need to upload large MRI files).

3. Installation
List dependencies using requirements.txt.

4. Usage
How to run notebooks or scripts for computing uncertainty, plotting results, and reproducing figures.

5. Results
Summarize your findings (global vs boundary uncertainty, correlations).

6. Discussion
State that MC Dropout shows limited boundary uncertainty in this task.

7. License
Choose an open-source license (MIT is simple and permissive).
